Adjustable stand for Elektron Octatrack, 0-30 degrees viewing angle.

Illustrator file is ready for submission to RazorLab/Ponoko. Please note, the cutouts for screw mounting are fairly wide to accommodate drafting inaccuracies, you will need to use oversized washers or screws with large heads. The Illustrator file includes a guide layer should you want to improve the accuracy of the design however the actual cutting layer is no longer registered with the guide to make the stand fit within the cutting area. I used 3 mm acrylic and there's a little give left to right so you might want to try 5mm instead although most of the force in operation is front to back so it's not essential
